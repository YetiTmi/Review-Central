# Review-Central
School project by Team Yeti


This contains the full version of the ReviewCentral web application. 

ReviewCentral has five pages, index page is for users that dont want to login or register to the site. There are separate pages for login and register. After loging in the user can see the mainfeed page. Within the mainfeed page user is able to like and view other peoples posted reviews and upload new reviews. Uploading a review has four steps. User will need to inputsthe name, prize, category and the rating of the product. ReviewCentral has four categories to choose from, mobilephones, televisions, computers or tablets. In the profile page user can see own uploads and delete them if need be.

To get ReviewCentral to your computer you will have to install this repository as a zip or clone it. Node modules are not included here, so you will have to download those by yourself.

Node modules that you will need are:

$ npm i passport-local

$ npm i bcrypt-nodejs

$ npm i express

$ npm i express-session

$ npm i cookie-parser

$ npm i body-parser

$ npm i morgan

$ npm i passport

$ npm i connect-flash

$ npm i mysql

$ npm i sharp

$ npm i multer

$ npm i .env

You will also need a mysql database with three tables. For more insight on the database you will need, see the sql files we have attached to the repository.


When you are all done with the dependencies to get the application running, you will need to type the ($ npm start) command in the directory the application files are located in.
